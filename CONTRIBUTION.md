## Some Important Terminologies
### Molecules
A molecule is a compound component made up of various atoms. It represents a more intricate UI element designed to fulfill a specific function within an application's interface. For example, a JSON to Table or an OTP (One-Time Password) Input Molecule, each composed of multiple atoms to provide a comprehensive and functional unit.

All molecules currently supported can be viewed on this [website](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app/).

 

## Usage 

To get started with Stencil-UI, you can use the hosted version of the product to check all the available molecules. You can get started immediately at [stencil-ui-templates](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app/). The [website](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app) provides an overview of the application, and additional information on the product and guides can be found in the [docs](https://stencil-docs.vercel.app/).


## Development
 Pre-requisites

To start development on Stencil UI, make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/)

### Running Stencil UI

> **Note**
> It is also possible to start development with GitHub Codespaces. When navigating to `< > Code`, select `Codespaces` instead of `Local`. Click on either the `+` sign or the `Create codespace on master` button.

Stencil UI uses a monorepo architecture - powered by [Turbo Repo](https://turbo.build/repo) - where multiple applications and libraries exist in a single repository. To set up a local development environment, follow these steps:

**BEFORE** you run the following steps, make sure:
- You have TypeScript installed locally on your machine: `npm install -g typescript`
- You are using a supported Node.js version (check `engines` `node` in the [package.json](./package.json))
- You are using a supported npm version (check `engines` `npm` in the [package.json](./package.json))


1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/SamagraX-Stencil/stencil-web && cd stencil-web && yarn install
    ```
2. To start the local development

- first, create a build of all packages using

    ```bash
    turbo build
    ```

- now start the project

    ```bash
    turbo dev
    ```
> **Note**
>   The above command will start all bot-app/ and all-molecule-example/ on the 7001 and 3001 ports respectively

The development environment should now be set up.Happy hacking! ðŸ‘¾

## How to Create a New Molecule
---

All the new Molecules are created via the `packages` folder in the repo.

stencil-ui/
stencil-ui/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ molecules/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config-manager/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chatui/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ provider/

Any kind of new molecule is create inside the `packages/molecule/src` folder that will house multiple other packages that can be used anywhere.
 
 Each Molecule should come with it's StoryBook and Unit.
 
 > Checkout the `packages/molecule/src/list` for a example Molecule Structure

### Step 1: Creating a new Molecule

1. **Navigate** to the `packages` directory

    ```bash 
    cd packages/molecule/src
    ```

2. **Create** a new directory for your molecule.
    ```bash
        mkdir new-molecule
        cd molecules/new-molecule
    ```

3. **Setup** the folder structure for your molecule.


4. **Implement** your molecule.
   - Create a `index.tsx` file for your molecule.
    ```tsx
    import React from 'react';

    interface NewMoleculeProps {
      items: string[];
    }

    const NewMolecule: React.FC<NewMoleculeProps> = ({ items }) => (
      <ul>
        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );

    export default NewMolecule;
    ```

### Step 2: Writing the Test Cases

1. **Install testing dependencies** (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    yarn add --dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
    ```
2. **Create** a test file for your component:

- Create a  `index.test.tsx` for the test file
  

    ```tsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
    import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';
    import NewMolecule from './NewMolecule';

    test('renders list items', () => {
      const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'];
      const { getByText } = render(<NewMolecule items={items} />);

      items.forEach(item => {
        expect(getByText(item)).toBeInTheDocument();
      });
    });
    ```
3. **Run** the tests:

    ```bash
    yarn test
    ```

### Step 3: Add to Storybook

1. **Install** Storybook dependencies (if not already installed):

    ```bash
    yarn dlx sb init
    ```

2. **Create** a Storybook file for your component

- Create a `index.stories.tsx` for your component
  

    
     ```tsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { Meta, Story } from '@storybook/react';
    

    export default {
      title: 'Molecules/NewMolecule',
      component: NewMolecule,
    } as Meta;

    const Template: Story<NewMoleculeProps> = (args) => <NewMolecule {...args} />;

    export const Default = Template.bind({});
    Default.args = {
      items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'],
    };
    ```

3. **Run** Storybook:
    ```bash
    yarn storybook
    ```


## Conclusion
You have now created a new molecule, written test cases for it, and added it to Storybook. Great job! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to the team. Happy coding! ðŸ‘¾
